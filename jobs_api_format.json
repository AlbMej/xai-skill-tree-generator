This is a small, elite unit reporting directly to Elon. The team works closely with both engineering and recruiting teams to create novel approaches for rapidly scaling the hiring of exceptional people. Who are you&nbsp; You believe assembling high-performance teams is an engineering problem. You love being around exceptional people and they love being around you. You are a nerdy engineer at heart, but your friends believe you are a “people person” You’ve built cool products yourself, even as a kid—perhaps personal projects, open-source contributions, or innovative hacks that demonstrate your technical creativity. You’ve worked at organizations with incredible talent density. And you referred in great people, and helped with recruiting. You might not be hands-on coding every day, but you’re comfortable with \"vibe coding\" and can quickly grasp technical concepts to evaluate candidates. About the Role For any hiring need at xAI, start by asking: “Who are the absolute best people in the world for this role?” Your focus will be on developing systems to effectively identify, engage, and attract those individuals. Once you develop the system you are also expected to execute and the hiring end to end yourself. We recognize that identifying the “best people” rarely happens solely on LinkedIn; instead, it occurs through referrals, networking at events, hosting competitions, leveraging specific online communities, and other creative channels. You are expected to exercise strong judgment and an intuitive understanding of what excellence looks like across various technical and non-technical domains.
